### **Table 2: Characteristic Geophysical Signatures**

#### **Gamma Ray (Natural Radioactivity) - API Units**

| Lithology | Typical Range (API) | Distinguishing Features | Geological Context |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Coal** | 15-150 (any value possible) | Typically low (<30 API), but can be uraniferous (up to 150+ API) | Low in potassium, thorium; uranium may be absorbed |
| **Sandstone (clean quartz)** | 15-30 | Low radioactivity; immature sands with K-feldspar can be higher (up to 200 API) | Mature sands have low clay content |
| **Siltstone** | 40-80 | Intermediate between sand and shale | Higher clay content than sandstone |
| **Mudstone/Claystone** | 60-120 | High due to clay minerals (illite, smectite) | Contains potassium in clay minerals |
| **Shale** | 60-150 | Very high, especially organic-rich shales | High clay and organic content |
| **Limestone** | 10-40 | Low to moderate | Pure carbonates have low radioactivity |
| **Dolomite** | 15-40 | Low to moderate; "hot" dolomite can reach 200 API | Uranium enrichment possible |

#### **Density (Bulk Density) - g/cm³**

| Lithology | Short-space Density | Long-space Density | Key Characteristics |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Coal** | 0.7-1.5 | 0.7-1.8 | Very low density; rank affects density (higher rank = higher density) |
| **Sandstone** | 2.2-2.65 | 2.2-2.65 | Porosity reduces density; quartz density = 2.65 g/cm³ |
| **Siltstone** | 2.4-2.65 | 2.4-2.65 | Slightly higher than clean sand due to finer grains |
| **Mudstone/Claystone** | 2.2-2.65 | 2.2-2.65 | Increases with compaction; overpressured shales are less dense |
| **Shale** | 2.4-2.8 | 2.4-2.8 | High compaction increases density |
| **Limestone** | 2.71 | 2.71 | Pure calcite = 2.71 g/cm³ |
| **Dolomite** | 2.87 | 2.87 | Pure dolomite = 2.87 g/cm³ |

#### **Resistivity - Ω·m (Ohm-meters)**

| Lithology | Typical Range | Fluid Dependence | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Coal** | 10-10,000+ | High resistivity; lignites with high moisture can be lower | Very high compared to surrounding rocks; sharp boundaries |
| **Sandstone** | 1-10,000+ | Highly dependent on porosity and fluid (water vs hydrocarbon) | Clean sands: high; shaly sands: lower |
| **Siltstone** | 10-100 | Moderate, depends on clay content | Intermediate between sand and shale |
| **Mudstone/Claystone** | 1-100 | Low to moderate, conductive due to clay-bound water | Typically lower than sandstone |
| **Shale** | 1-50 | Very low due to high conductivity of clay minerals | Can mask hydrocarbon zones (low resistivity pay) |
| **Limestone** | 10-10,000+ | Variable; tight limestone high, porous limestone lower | Can be confused with coal on resistivity alone |
| **Dolomite** | 10-10,000+ | Similar to limestone | Often higher than limestone when tight |

#### **Neutron Porosity (Apparent Porosity) - % or p.u.**

| Lithology | Typical Response | Hydrogen Index | Key Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Coal** | Very high (50-60+ p.u.) | High due to carbon content | Not true porosity; carbon mimics hydrogen |
| **Sandstone** | 15-30% (porous) | Depends on fluid content | True porosity indication |
| **Siltstone** | 20-35% | Moderate | Includes clay-bound water |
| **Mudstone/Claystone** | 30-50% | High due to bound water | Not effective porosity |
| **Shale** | 30-60% | Very high due to clay-bound water | Exaggerated porosity reading |
| **Limestone** | 0-30% | Depends on true porosity | Accurate when clean |
| **Dolomite** | 0-25% | Similar to limestone | Slightly different matrix response |

### **Table 3: Diagnostic Crossplot Signatures**

#### **Neutron-Density Crossplot Patterns**

| Lithology | Neutron-Density Separation | Characteristic Pattern |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Coal** | Both very high | Neutron and density both read high apparent porosity |
| **Sandstone (water-filled)** | Density left of neutron by ~2 divisions | Typical cross-over |
| **Sandstone (gas-filled)** | Increased separation (~5 divisions) | Density left, neutron very low |
| **Limestone** | No separation | Overlay exactly on compatible scale |
| **Dolomite** | Density right of neutron by 4-6 divisions | Significant separation |
| **Shale** | Neutron left of density | Large separation, neutron very high |

#### **Gamma Ray vs Resistivity Discrimination**

| Lithology | Gamma Ray | Resistivity | Diagnostic Pattern |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Coal** | Low | Very High | Low GR + High Resistivity |
| **Clean Sandstone** | Low | High | Low GR + High Resistivity |
| **Shaly Sandstone** | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate GR + Moderate Resistivity |
| **Shale** | High | Low | High GR + Low Resistivity |
| **Limestone** | Low | Variable | Low GR + Variable Resistivity |

### **Table 4: Coal-Specific Signatures**

#### **Coal Rank Geophysical Characteristics**

| Coal Rank | Density (g/cm³) | Resistivity (Ω·m) | Gamma Ray (API) | Acoustic Transit Time (μs/ft) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Lignite** | 0.7-1.2 | 10-100 (lower due to moisture) | 15-40 | 140-160 |
| **Sub-bituminous** | 1.2-1.5 | 100-1,000 | 15-40 | 120-140 |
| **Bituminous** | 1.3-1.6 | 1,000-10,000 | 15-40 | 100-120 |
| **Anthracite** | 1.4-1.8 | 10,000+ | 15-40 | 80-100 |

#### **Coal Bed Identification Criteria**

1. **Density Log:** Primary indicator - density <1.8 g/cm³
2. **Resistivity Log:** High deflection compared to adjacent rocks
3. **Gamma Ray:** Typically low, but check for uranium enrichment
4. **Caliper Log:** Often shows washouts due to caving
5. **Neutron Log:** High apparent porosity
6. **Acoustic Log:** High transit time (low velocity)

### **Table 5: Lithology Discrimination Guidelines**

#### **Quick-Look Identification Rules**

| If... | And... | Then likely lithology is... |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| Density <1.8 g/cm³ | Resistivity very high | **Coal** |
| Density 2.2-2.65 g/cm³ | Gamma Ray <30 API | **Sandstone** |
| Density 2.2-2.65 g/cm³ | Gamma Ray 40-80 API | **Siltstone** |
| Density 2.2-2.65 g/cm³ | Gamma Ray >60 API | **Shale/Claystone** |
| Density ~2.71 g/cm³ | Gamma Ray low | **Limestone** |
| Density ~2.87 g/cm³ | Gamma Ray low | **Dolomite** |
| Neutron very high | Density very low | **Coal** (not washout) |

#### **Common Pitfalls and Confusions**

1. **Coal vs. Washouts:** Both show low density; check caliper log for hole enlargement
2. **Coal vs. Gas Sand:** Both show density-neutron separation; use resistivity and GR
3. **Shale vs. "Hot" Dolomite:** Both have high GR; check density and Pe (photoelectric)
4. **Limestone vs. Coal:** Both can have high resistivity; use density (coal <1.8, limestone ~2.71)

### **Table 6: Regional Variations and Exceptions**

| Region | Notable Characteristics | Key Differentiators |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Powder River Basin** | Sandstones gradational with shale; coal sharp boundaries | Resistivity curve shape (parallel for coal) |
| **Appalachian Basin** | Limestone absent in coal measures | Easier coal identification |
| **Illinois Basin** | Limestone present in sequence | Need multiple logs for coal ID |
| **Northern Great Plains** | Gamma ray diagnostic for coal | Low GR = coal in Tertiary sequence |
| **Midcontinent** | Limestone abundant | Supplementary logs needed for coal ID |
