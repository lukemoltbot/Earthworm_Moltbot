- **Shales:** Density 2.3-2.7 g/cc, GR 70-150+ API, Resistivity 2-30 ohm-m
- **Limestones:** Density 2.5-2.8 g/cc, GR 10-30 API, Resistivity 100-1000+ ohm-m
- **Coal:** Density 1.2-1.6 g/cc, GR 15-40 API, Resistivity 50-1000+ ohm-m

### 2. Basin-Specific Patterns
- **Cooper Basin:** Clear sand-shale alternations, source rock identification
- **Surat Basin:** Cyclic fluvial sequences, coal seam markers
- **Bowen Basin:** Multiple coal measures, volcanic interbeds
- **Perth Basin:** Marine vs non-marine discrimination, clean sand signatures

### 3. Geophysical Interpretation
- **Density:** Primary lithology discriminator, porosity indicator
- **Gamma Ray:** Shale content estimator, sequence stratigraphy tool
- **Resistivity:** Fluid content indicator, formation quality measure
- **Short/Long Space Density:** Invasion and alteration indicators
