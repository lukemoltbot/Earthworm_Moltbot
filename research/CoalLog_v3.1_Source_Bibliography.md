## Recommendations for Future Research

### High Priority:
1. Compilation of European coal geophysics data (Ruhr Basin, UK)
2. Chinese coal basin studies translation and compilation
3. Modern LWD data collection in coal exploration

### Medium Priority:

2. Very old historical data compilation
3. Anecdotal/mining company internal data
