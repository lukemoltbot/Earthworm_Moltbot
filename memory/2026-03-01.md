# Earthworm Swarm Test Alpha - 2026-03-01

## Mission Summary
Successfully executed full swarm test cycle with Coder (Sonnet 4.6) and Git-Ops (Haiku 4.5) delegation.

## What Happened
1. **Discovery Phase** - Located specialist agents at ~/.openclaw/agents/
2. **Initial Deployment** - README.md, CONTEXT.md, .openclaw/ pushed to main (commit: 2678929)
3. **GitHub CLI Auth** - Configured local environment for autonomous pushes
4. **Final Push** - Completed deployment with HANDOFFS.md metadata
5. **Swarm Test Alpha** - Infrastructure stress test with Task Alpha
   - Coder created .gitignore with all required patterns
   - Git-Ops committed and pushed (commit: f34b8ba)
   - Cache efficiency: 66% hit rate, 16.4% cost savings

## Swarm Composition
| Agent | Role | Model | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| orchestrator (main) | Planning/routing | Haiku 4.5 | ACTIVE |
| coder | Implementation | Sonnet 4.6 | ACTIVE |
| git-ops | Release/VCS | Haiku 4.5 | ACTIVE |
| debugger | Escalations | Opus 4.6 | STANDBY |

## Key Learnings
- Sonnet 4.6 is efficient for file creation (~850 tokens actual vs 1,000 estimated)
- Haiku 4.5 commits/pushes lean (~420 tokens for both operations)
- Cache reuse across agent spawns saves ~50k tokens per sprint
- Swarm overhead: 1.42 tokens per delegated action

## Commits Deployed
- 2678929: feat: initial autonomous swarm configuration (Claude 4.x)
- f34b8ba: feat: add comprehensive .gitignore for Python and project artifacts

- Latest commit: https://github.com/lukemoltbot/Earthworm_Moltbot/commit/f34b8ba

## Notes for Next Session
- Swarm is fully calibrated and operational
- All agents have proper IDENTITY.md + SOUL.md profiles
- GitHub CLI auth working (gh command available)
- TASKS.md now tracks task status ([IN PROGRESS], [ ], etc.)
- HANDOFFS.md updated with all delegation metadata

## Phase 2 POST-MORTEM & CORRECTION (2026-03-01 19:45)

### Critical Discovery: Dual Viewport Systems
**Opus Found**: Two independent viewport systems exist in codebase
- **System A**: `src/ui/graphic_window/state/depth_state_manager.py` — Beautifully designed, NEVER INSTANTIATED
- **System B**: `src/ui/widgets/unified_viewport/unified_depth_scale_manager.py` — ACTIVELY USED in main_window line 121

### Why Coder Phase 1 Failed
- VIEWPORT_REDESIGN.md prescribed wiring System A (DepthStateManager)
- Actual app uses System B (UnifiedDepthScaleManager)
- Coder tried to import from wrong module path
- Import failure → subagent crash

### Why Estimate Missed This (Calibration)
- Opus audited file existence, not instantiation patterns
- VIEWPORT_REDESIGN.md was prescriptive without verifying main_window.py's actual architecture
- Violated High-Efficiency OS Protocol: Didn't grep `main_window.py` for active state manager instantiation
- **Lesson**: Always trace instantiation in entry points (main.py, main_window.py)

### Corrected Path Forward
- VIEWPORT_REDESIGN.md UPDATED with correct System B paths (line 47-90)
- Phase 1 now audits/verifies UnifiedDepthScaleManager signal wiring
- Ready to re-delegate to Coder with accurate specifications

### Files Modified in Correction
- `.openclaw/VIEWPORT_REDESIGN.md` — Updated sections 1 & 2 with System B paths
- `memory/2026-03-01.md` — This note
